        <h2 class="heading">Brief History Of The Angel Cake</h2>
        <p class="history">Angel food cake is a type of sponge cake made with egg white, sugar and cake flour. The absence of egg yolk and fat  makes it a good low fat and low calorie alternative to a classic short cake
            Angel food cake was first developed in the 1880s in St. Louis, Missouri. The first detailed recipe of this cake was published in the Boston Cooking School Cook Book in 1884.2
            
            By the 1930s, the angel food cake recipe was firmly established. During this time several research efforts were pursued to better understand the science behind the manufacturing process.2 Today, this cake is a staple of American cuisine and it’s commonly consumed with fresh strawberries.
