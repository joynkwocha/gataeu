        <h2 class="heading">Brief History Of The Tres Leches Cake</h2>
        <p class="history">It’s not possible to answer the question – where is Tres Leches from – in a straightforward fashion. Some would argue that this is a dessert of purely Latin American origin, with further discussion over whether the cake was created for the first time in Nicaragua or Mexico. And at the same time, they would be both right and wrong. While Tres Leches cake was first made and served in Latin America, it still has its ties all the way to Europe.

            In the 19th century, a recipe for a custard bread cake that was soaked in wine was really popular in Mexico. It’s believed that this particular recipe was a spin of the English trifle or Italian tiramisu at the time since both of these are sponge cakes with heavy cream, soaked in alcohol. It’s no wonder that these recipes became popular in Mexico during the 19th century as this was the time of the New World and strong European influence.
            
            We can trace the origin of Tres Leches cake’s mainstream popularity to the 1930s when Nestle opened its plants in Mexico and had a recipe for this spongy goodness printed on the packages of evaporated and condensed milk as well as cream cans. However, the actual origin of the Tres Leches cake cannot be credited to Nestle. Before the company began printing the recipe, Tres Leches has already become a favorite dessert of many households in Latin America. In that sense, when and where exactly Tres Leches truly originated is still a mystery.
